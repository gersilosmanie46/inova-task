/*
 * The code above showcases a sophisticated simulation of a virtual ecosystem,
 * where organisms interact with each other.
 * 
 * The ecosystem consists of plants and animals. Plants can perform photosynthesis,
 * while animals can eat organisms. Both plants and animals can grow every second.
 * 
 * The code creates instances of plants and animals and simulates their interactions
 * by printing messages to the console. It also simulates the passage of time by
 * growing organisms and checking if they die.
